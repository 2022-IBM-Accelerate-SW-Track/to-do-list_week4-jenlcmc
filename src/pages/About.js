              Hi, my name is Uyen Tran. In Fall 2022, I will be junior study
              Computer Science at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Few facts
              about me are: I can speak Vietnamese I have 4 dogs. 2 of them are
              Shih Tzu and 2 of them are Huskies. What I love to do during my
              free time are drawing, painting, playing video games. I'm a big
              fan of playstation console and can't wait for new-gen games. For
              the last semester, I was an TA for Computer Science 1 in my
              school. So I really hope to improve my skills through this course.
